	<p>not consumer mode.  In creator mode. I will blow my own mind. 

	Don't look at boot camp as a package.  Don't rob ourself or others. Become a mad scientist to fix something, instead of complaining that your service is shit. 

	Fear. 
	That you will be average. That you know too much already. 
	Go far and fast together!
	You will be humbled by a challange, but you can learn the most with this.  Failure is necssary. </p>
