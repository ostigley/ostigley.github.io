						Reading chapter 7 of Search Inside Yourself, I enjoyed reading about the link between self-awareness, empathy, intelligence and kindness.  I agree that if our own self-awareness is weak, our empathy will also be weak.
					</p>

					<p>
						These are some of my favourite excerpts: 
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>
							“Empathy does not necessarily mean agreeing. It is possible to understand another person at both an intellectual and a visceral level with kindness, and still respectfully disagree. Aristotle said, “It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.”<br>
							<br>
							“Empathy increases with kindness. Kindness is the engine of empathy; it motivates you to care, and it makes you more receptive to others, and them to you. The more kindness you offer to people, the better you can empathize with them.”<br>
							<br>
							“It all begins with trust. The absence of trust is the root cause of all other dysfunctions. ”
						</em>
					</p>

						Of course applying this to a work environment presents it's own challenges. I really liked the piece about praising people for their hard work, instead of being smart.  This applies even more so to women in the work place, where more often than not, women are complimented on the way they look, instead of the work they are doing.  I read about this today in <a href="http://qz.com/659196/i-had-so-many-advantages-and-i-barely-made-it-pinterests-tracy-chou-on-sexism-in-tech/" target="blank">an article about sexism in Silicon Valley</a>.
