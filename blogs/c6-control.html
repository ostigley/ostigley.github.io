								I found chapter 5 of Search Inside Yourself to be the most interesting yet. Handling your emotions through self assessment and self control can be very difficult.  The goal is to be in control of the physical responses you experience with emotions. 
							</p>

							<p>
								I loved the Buddha metaphor for this,   "like writing on water".  Whenever a difficult emotion arises in an enlightened mind, it is like writing on water; the moment it is written, it disappears.  
							</p>

							<p>
								I also found the section on letting go very interesting.  The premise of this section is that most unhappiness people experience comes from either grasping, or averting.  Grasping is when the mind desperately holds on to something and refuses to let it go.  Aversion is when the mind desperately keeps something away and refuses to let it come.  These two are opposites of each other.   I think this is very true!

								The Siberian North Railroad technique resonated with me.  Stop, breath, notice, reflect, respond.   As someone who has a tendency to lash out under stress, I need to do more of this.

								<h6>The Guest House</h6>
							<p>
								<em>
									This being human is a guest house.<br>
									Every morning a new arrival.<br><br>
									A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br>
									some momentary awareness comes<br>
									as an unexpected visitor.<br><br>
									Welcome and entertain them all!<br>
									Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br>
									who violently sweep your house<br>
									empty of its furniture,<br><br>
									still, treat each guest honourably.<br>
									He may be clearing you out<br>
									for some new delight.<br><br>
									The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br>
									meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.<br><br>
									Be grateful for whatever comes.<br>
									because each has been sent<br>
									as a guide from beyond.<br><br>
									â€” Jellaludin Rumi,
								</em>
