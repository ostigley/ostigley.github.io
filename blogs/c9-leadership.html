						Search Inside Yourself discusses compassionate leadership, and how it can effect the workplace and individuals.  I find leaders that I can have a friendly relationship with, to be better at their job.  Even the hard conversations can be had in a frank manner, because if the built in trust that has been established.  Uncompassionate leadership makes it very difficult to accept feedback from a manager, because there is no trust involved.  I have experienced both in my career.

							I enjoyed the Tonglen meditation.  It reminded me a lot of various Star Trek episodes which touch on Vulcan mind exercises, lol!  Both use the concept of breathing light in and out, which seems to make me feel good.

							The SCARF model (Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness) echoes several moments in my career to date.  As for Phase 0 of bootcamp, I don’t think it has had the chance to reflect any bits of that model, because we haven’t been working that closely yet.  Perhaps this will happen in the rest of the bootcamp, but hopefully not too much.
