						This week I paired up with a fellow student, Uili, to complete the freecodecamp challenge to create a javascript calculator.  It is how I came across the eva() function.
					</p>

					<p>
						What a life saver.  What a time saver.  Somehow I wasn’t aware of this method, so my plans were rather more complicated, creating various methods to call depending on which operator keys were pressed.  Instead we just collected a string of the buttons pressed, and passed it to the eval() function.  Here’s the calculator we whipped up in a few hours, nothing too fancy, but a good exercise in what we have been learning this week.

						Boom!  Each time I learn a new function or method that seems so obvious, I get really excited about learning new stuff.  The alternative negative approach of “how the hell did I not know about that?  I’m so stupid” is al too easy to fall in to.  Lightbulb moments are amazing!
