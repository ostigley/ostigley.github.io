					<h5>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5>
				<p>
					It's cool to know that we are reading a book that many Google employees also have to read as part of their emotional intelligence training. I particularly like the different ways of thinking about mindfulness, and attention.  <em>"paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgementally"</em>
				</p>


				<p>
					I've believed for many years that emotional well being has a direct impact on physical well being.  Not that I'm good at keeping things like stress and frustration in check.
				</p>


				<p>
					I believe there is value in this exploring this subject.  It offers insight, and it's healthy to explore with the goal of trying to become a better person.  Something I always try, and occasionally fail, to do. 
				</p>

				<h5>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
				<p>
					Very good!  I occasionally meditate, so I am used to the sense of calmness.  I find yoga also helps focus the mind in to a state of calmness as well.  For me, there is a link on focussing on the poses, combined with the difficulty and physicality of the poses, that clears the mind.  I once described to a friend, that doing yoga made me feel like a puddle of calm water in a rough sea, with ripples of calm radiating out in to the rough.  In other words, it makes me calm and happier, which then has an effect on others interact with. 
				</p>
			
				<p>
					I personally find focussing on my breath to be the best way to have introspective, calm moments.  The 'Easier Way' of doing nothing but being for 2 minutes just wouldn't work for me.  I have too many things to worry about!  My breathing helps me not think about those things, so I opt for that method.
