					 <h5>Thoughts on Medidation</h5>
					 <p>
					 	My thoughts on meditation were not changed by the content of Search Inside Yourself, Chapter 2.  I have meditated in the past, and believe it is just like exercise, only for the mind.    If it can become a regular habit (the hard part), it can reduce stress, and make you an happier person.  I really do believe that.  
					 </p>
					
					 <h5>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
					 <p>
					 	Not particularly, as they are already techniques I am aware of.  I prefer to sit in a comfortable position, and focus on my breathing.  Allowing feelings to come and go, noises and surrounding distractions to wash through me.  I liked the analogy in Search Inside Yourself that described emotions as a ball you can observe, play with, and put down.  But only if you accept their existence in the firs place. 
					 </p>
					 <p>
					 	Here's a picture of me and some fellow teachers meditating with one of my students in Luang Prabang, Laos. It was an amazing experience!
