						While learning some javascript testing frameworks this week (Tape), I noted that one of my tests was failing persistently, no matter what I did: <br>
					</p>
<pre><code style="font-size: 50%;">test('make Friendly Dates', function (t) {
	t.equal( makeFriendlyDates(["2017-03-01", "2017-05-05”]), ["March 1st, 2017","May 5th”] );
	t.end();
});</code></pre>


					<p>
						The first function makeFriendlyDates was producing the right output, but my test was failing.  Why? Because javascript cannot test the equity of two arrays, that’s why.  For example [1,2,3] == [1,2,3] will return false.  To test array equality, you need to evaluate each index against each other.  As a quick solution, I evaluated <code>array.join(“ “) == array.join(“ “)</code>, turning my arrays in to strings, which then evaluated true.
					</p>

					<p>
						Boom!  Each time I learn a new secret that seems so obvious, I get really excited.  The alternative negative approach of “how the hell did I not know about that?  I’m so stupid” is al too easy to fall in to.  Lightbulb moments are amazing!
