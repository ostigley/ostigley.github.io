					<h5>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h5>
					<p>
						I'm experimenting with the pomodoro technique, which I have heard of but not used before.  I'm also planning my days quite carefully, so I know what I'm trying to achieve each day.  I spare 15minutes each day, planning the next day.  This makes it easier for me to muck in without hesitation
					</p>


					<h5>What did you find interesting?</h5>
					<p>
						I found the concept of making small habits over time to achieve big changes, interesting. In particular the use of existing behaviours to trigger those habits. 
					</p>
					<p>
						The same applies to 'think big' 'start small'.  In a sense this is almost agile thinking.  Breaking large tasks in to small rolling jobs, to make the process smoother and easier to achieve.
					</p>


					<h5>What worked for you?</h5>
					<p>Ask me again in 3 months</p>

					<h5>Which will you experiment further with?</h5>
					<p>I'm going to continue with habit creation, specifically using behavioural triggers.</p>
