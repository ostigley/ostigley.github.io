						Self-awareness is knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions, according to Daniel Goleman.   It is the key domain to emotional intelligence. "The moment you see a raging river, you are already rising above it." It is a mode that maintains self reflection even in times of emotional turbulence. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Mindfulness is very similar, it is  a type of way of paying attention, on purpose, non judgementally. It is almost the same as self-awareness.
					</p>

					<p>
						I had a brief attempt at a body scan, and found it ok.  It isn't really my thing.   
					</p>

					<p>
						I liked the statement that emotions are a physiological response. That approach certainly helps objectify them.  Treat them like a ball you are holding, which you can put down.
