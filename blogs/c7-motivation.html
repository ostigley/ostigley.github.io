							<h5>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
							<p> 
								This lens certainly made me think about who I am, and what I am doing in life.  I'm not sure I came up with any substantial answers.  I have many things that I like doing, that I'm passionate about, but I'm not sure the connection to purpose is as direct as I'd like.  I enjoyed the segment on 'flow' a lot, as it put to words exactly they way I feel when I'm writing code, getting my hands dirty.   
							</p>

							<h5>What are my core values</h5>
							<p>
								This question is significantly harder to answer than 'Search Inside Yourself' suggests. All I know, is that I'm constantly trying to make myself a better person, and create happiness in my life.  I'm also not ready to have an open conversation about it either.  I feel like I have nothing to say...!
							</p>
							<p>
								This is not to say that I'm not happy, or that I think I'm not a good person.  It's just that I think that it is important to consciously assess whether you could be handling situations more positively,  and exercising and growing my emotional intelligence. I also think that happiness is something  you create, not something you find.  So it is important learn about yourself continuously, so that you know what happiness really means. 
							</p>

							<h5>What do I stand for?</h5>
							<p>
								I find it hard to comprehend that we are lucky to be alive in the first place..... the chances are infinitesimally small.  Then, while we are alive, we fly around a massive black hole at the centre of our galaxy, simultaneously floating around a gigantic hydrogen bomb riding on some neatly formed rock called Earth.  I'm humbled by this, and I think we can all benefit from being a little more humble toward each other. 
							</p>	

							<h5>What else...</h5>
							<p>
								I love the concept of 'flow'.  It resonated with my a lot, getting lost in problems and code, is exactly why I love doing it.  I hope I can turn this satisfaction in to a wider positive experience and career.
